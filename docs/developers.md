# GitHub Repositories Related to ResStock
These repositories are publicly available to use, but we are not able to provide technical support or documentation for running ResStock at this time. We strongly suggest and support using the public datasets. The data outputs from the initial ResStock release can be found by visiting the [Data](https://nrel.github.io/ResStock.github.io/docs/data.html) page.

## ResStock Repository
The [ResStock repository](https://github.com/NREL/resstock) contains the source code for building and executing ResStock models, including upgrade scenarios. It also links to a [Technical Development Guide](https://resstock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which has basic and advanced tutorials.

## OpenStudio-HPXML Repository
ResStock relies heavily on [OpenStudio-HPXML](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-HPXML), which provides a method for simulating residential buildings with OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. OpenStudio-HPXML uses a series of OpenStudio measures to generate an EnergyPlus model for each sample based on the building and occupant characteristics defined by ResStock. In many cases, ResStock relies upon the OpenStudio-HPXML default arguments and calculations.

## Buildstock Batch Repository
Execution of the ResStock workflow is managed through the [buildstockbatch repository](https://github.com/nrel/buildstockbatch), a shared asset of ResStock and ComStock. It is specifically developed to scale to execution of tens of millions of simulations through multiple infrastructure providers.

## BuildStock Query Repository
[buildstock-query](https://github.com/NREL/buildstock-query) is a Python library for querying datasets generated by ResStock and ComStock. Introductory tutorial videos can be found on the [NREL Learning BuildStock Analysis YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmmAHsOZAp8&list=PLmIn8Hncs7bEYCZiHaoPSovoBrRGR-tRS&index=6).
