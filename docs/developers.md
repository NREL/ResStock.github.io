# GitHub Reposititories Related to ResStock
These repositories are publicly available to use, but we are not able to provide technical support or documentation for running ResStock at this time. We strongly suggest and support using the public datasets. The data outputs from the initial ResStock release can be found by visiting the Data page.

## ResStock Repository
This repository contains the source code used to build and execute ResStock models, including upgrade scenarios. The ResStock model is under active calibration and development, which is publicly visible on [this repository](https://github.com/NREL/resstock).

## OpenStudio-Standards Repository
ResStock relies heavily on [openstudio-standards](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards), a Ruby Gem library that extends the OpenStudio SDK. It has four main use-cases:
1.	Provide higher level methods to help BEM users and developers to create OpenStudio models from existing geometry, or programmatically generated geometry
2.	Create typical building models in OpenStudio format
3.	Create a code baseline model from a proposed model
4.	Check a model against a code/standard.

## Buildstock Batch Repository
Execution of the ResStock workflow is managed through the [buildstockbatch repository](https://github.com/nrel/buildstockbatch), a shared asset of ResStock and ComStock. It is specifically developed to scale to execution of tens of millions of simulations through multiple infrastructure providers.

## BuildStock Query Repository
[buildstock-query](https://github.com/NREL/buildstock-query) is a Python library for querying datasets generated by ResStock and ComStock. Introductory tutorial videos can be found on the [NREL Learning BuildStock Analysis YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmmAHsOZAp8&list=PLmIn8Hncs7bEYCZiHaoPSovoBrRGR-tRS&index=6).
