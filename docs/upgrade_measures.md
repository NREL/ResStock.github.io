# Upgrade Measures
Beginning in ResStock 2025 Release 1, the same set of measures will be run with each dataset release, with the addition of a few measures each time. The below table summarizes when each measure was first included and links to the measure documentation.

The measure documentation describes the modeling methodology, assumptions, and observations from results. The assumptions used for the measures represent one of the multiple possible approaches for a technology. They are intended to be reasonable, but may not necessarily be optimal.

New datasets include new measures as well as updates to the ResStock baseline model.
