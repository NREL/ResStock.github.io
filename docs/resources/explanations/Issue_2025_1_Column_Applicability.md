# Issue Report: ResStock 2025 Release 1 Column Applicability
## Summary of Issue
A column is only filled out correctly for one upgrade, when it should be filled out for all upgrades. There are three instances of this. The missing information can be determined through other columns in the dataset.

The first instance is **upgrade.heating_fuel** which only has two potential values, “Natural Gas” and “None”. That means for all heat pump upgrades, even if a heat pump gets applied, the **upgrade.heating_fuel** is marked as “None”. The second instance is for **upgrade.hvac_heating_type_and_fuel** which only has two values of “Natural Gas Fuel Furnace” and “None”. These columns are only correct for the first upgrade, Natural Gas furnace, and are incorrectly filled out for the other upgrades in this dataset.

The third instance is **upgrade.hvac_detailed_performance_data** which only has two potential values, “Cold Climate Heat Pump Ducted” and “None”. These values are only correct for upgrade 4, Cold Climate Ducted Air Source Heat Pump, and are incorrectly filled out for the other upgrades in this dataset.

## Status
Impacts ResStock 2025 Release 1 (ResStock 2025.1) AMY2018 and AMY2012 datasets only. Preliminary investigation complete. Detailed investigation complete.

## Details
Two columns, **upgrade.heating_fuel** and **upgrade.hvac_heating_type_and_fuel** were only correctly applied in upgrade 01, Natural Gas Furnace 95% AFUE. One additional column, **upgrade.hvac_detailed_performance_data**, was only correctly applied in upgrade 04, Cold Climate Air-Source Heat Pump.

**upgrade.heating_fuel**, as noted in the [enumeration dictionary](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2025/resstock_amy2018_release_1/enumeration_dictionary.tsv) for this release, only has two potential values: “Natural Gas” and “None”. That means for other upgrades that are electric, such as the single-speed geothermal heat pump, their **upgrade.heating_fuel** is marked as “None” even though the final upgraded heating fuel is in fact electric for example. Similarly, the **upgrade.hvac_heating_type_and_fuel** only has two potential values, “Natural Gas Fuel Furnace” and “None”. Even if a model gets a change of heating system that is not a natural gas furnace, the column will show up as “None”. To fix this, infer the type of upgrade from other columns and ResStock documentation. For example, upgrade 02 in this dataset is the Propane Furnace 95% AFUE or Fuel Oil Furnace 88% AFUE. Looking at the **applicability** column and the **in.heating_fuel** column in the <ins>annual results files</ins> gives the needed information. Also check the dataset [readme](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2025/resstock_amy2018_release_1/README_resstock_20251.pdf) for a summary of applicability logic, or the upgrade specific documentation if it is released. For example, say the **applicability** column is marked as “True” and the **in.heating_fuel** column value is “Propane”, then a user can infer the upgrade was applied and actual value of the **upgrade.heating_fuel** should be “Propane”, and the **upgrade.hvac_heating_type_and_fuel** should be “Propane Fuel Furnace”. From the readme, the user knows that less efficient propane systems are upgraded only with the propane system, they are not upgraded with the fuel oil system. This is one example of how the actual value can be inferred.

**upgrade.hvac_detailed_performance_data**, also noted in the [enumeration dictionary](https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2025/resstock_amy2018_release_1/enumeration_dictionary.tsv) for this release, only has two potential values, “Cold Climate Heat Pump Ducted” and “None”. To find out the efficiency of other hvac systems in different upgrades, check out the **upgrade.hvac_heating_efficiency** column or the **upgrade.hvac_cooling_efficiency** column which will have the hvac system type and efficiency value.
