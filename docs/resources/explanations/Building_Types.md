# Building Types Not Represented in ResStock

ResStock represents all types of housing units, including single-family, multifamily, and manufactured or mobile homes. The definition of the residential sector follows the U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) definition of housing unit and therefore does not include dormitories, prisons, assisted care facilities, and other congregate housing situations, but does include high-rise multifamily buildings that are sometimes considered commercial buildings for the purpose of building codes.(U.S. Energy Information Administration 2024)
