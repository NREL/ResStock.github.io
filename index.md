[ResStock™](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/resstock.html), built on the [OpenStudio platform](http://openstudio.net), is a project geared at modeling existing residential building stocks at national, regional, or local scales with a high-degree of granularity (e.g., one physics-based simulation model for every 200 dwelling units), using the [EnergyPlus simulation engine](http://energyplus.net). Information about ComStock™, a sister tool for modeling the commercial building stock, can be found [here](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/comstock.html).
